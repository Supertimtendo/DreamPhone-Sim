# DreamPhone-Sim
Open Dream Dialer is a project to recreate Electronic Dream Phone in a computer software simulation. The project is divided into three goals:

1. Dream Phone Simulator: Recreate as accurately as possible the experience of playing Dream Phone via software recreation. This includes reverse engineering gameplay mechanics, scanning and archiving game board and card assets, and 'Dream Phone Device' dialing behavior and sound effects.

2. Open Dream Dialer: Once Dream Phone Simulator is complete, the goal will be to remove any copyrighted assets from the program and open source release as "Open Dream Dialer". This would include instructions, tools and/or assets for users to create custom game board, card and clue configurations.

3. Open Dream Dialer Device: With the ODD code complete, a "Device" can be made to emulate the behavior of the Dream Phone handset device. This currently is specified as using a Raspberry Pi Pico to run the main game code and audio playback, and I2S audio drivers playing MP3 files in response to the dialed inputs. This would serve as a drop-in alternative to the original Dream Phone handset, as well as opening the opportunity for Open Dream Phone custom user assets to be uploaded to the ODD-Device for custom audio reflecting new clue categories, boy names, responses, etc.
